# Dungeon of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch - A text based adventure game

## The Concept

You begin at character creation, with Viking, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and Gimp as your five basic classes. If you can complete the game with the Gimp, you get serious bonus points.

You start at dungeon tile one, and must make you way - one freaky tile at a time - towards that light at the end of the tunnel.

At any point, you may choose to do a number of things. Perhaps you want to inspect the area you are in? It might contain stuff that can help you; that switch might reveal a chest containing a potion. Or a bomb. But you’re not a cat and curiosity is probably a good thing*

Depending on your character class, you might want to take rest to heal any wounds; but don’t take too long - you only have a certain number of turns to complete the game (unless you’re the Gimp...but you will need to figure that one out by yourself).

Probably best to walk on, although it won’t be too long until you encounter a beast. This could range from the common dungeon mouse, to the rather less common dungeon Balrog. Luck will have a lot to do with this - feeling lucky?

Should you encounter a beast, you more or less have to fight. You can try to hide, but your chances are slim (and basically zero if you are the Viking or the Gimp...). Fighting will be up close and brutal, so you better make sure to use any special character abilities you might have. Vikings can war cry, Wizards can turn things into Gimps (including themselves if they are not careful), Clerics can pray (mostly useless) and Rogues can do some effective gymnastics. Gimps are almost completely useless in close or far ranged combat, preferring to go into submission.

Should you defeat this hell-wreath, you may continue and live to fight another turn. Better rest up. Tick tock....

Standard difficulty is as described. Hard difficulty is as described with the chance of a few particularly annoying random events, and Insane difficulty is random events plus  a Balrog tea party.

May the best completely made up character win. If you do, you can share your total score with probably no one, but hey you won.

Godspeed, adventurer! May you find glory more often than you find death (its pretty unlikely you will find glory, but you can at least sit back and admire your log of characters and how far they got).

Alternatively, you can go find a real game that has thoughtful design mechanics.

Yours codely,
Sir Richard

>*those who complete the dungeon do actually get the option to play again as Schrodinger’s cat, in which case you should probably reverse your philosophy on curiosity as this one definitely doesn’t get 9 lives...although it does exhibit potentially useful quantum properties and if you are clever may be able to use them...

> The name means "St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the fierce whirlpool of St Tysilio of the red cave" in Welsh. It's an actual place.
